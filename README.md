# DatarepAPI
Data Representation Project, Hosting an API for my module on Data Representation. This is part of my Data Analytics conversion course through GMIT. 

I have created the server into the file server.py, the DOA and the carviewer in html. I have added the image to the HTML page and that is in the repository too. 

The database was created through sql and linked to the server. 

This project was worth 60% of my final grade and was due for submission on the 21/12/19

I had an issue with the gitignore for the DBconfig file, I tried to include it in the gitignore but was commited to GitHub anyway.

I installed flask through venv and saved everything in requirements.txt
